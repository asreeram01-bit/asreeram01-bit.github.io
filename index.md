**Project Idea:**

Using quantum algorithms to improve how investors build the best mix of stocks in a portfolio.

**Background**

*Context*: In finance, one big challenge is deciding how to invest money across different stocks or assets. The goal is to maximize profit while also keeping risk low, which is called portfolio optimization. It’s a difficult problem because there are so many possible combinations to choose from, especially when working with large datasets. Quantum algorithms, like QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), can help solve these kinds of problems faster by leveraging qubits and superposition.

*Motivation*: To help financial professionals enhance their portfolio management, especially by minimizing any type of risk.

*References*: 
Huot, C., Kea, K., Kim, T.-K., & Han, Y. (2024). Enhancing Knapsack-based Financial Portfolio Optimization Using Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm
This paper shows how QAOA can be used to solve investment problems by modeling them as a “knapsack” problem, where you have to choose the best mix of assets. The authors test this by using financial data and show that QAOA can find better solutions than some classical methods. 

Brandhofer, S. et al. (2022). Benchmarking the performance of portfolio optimization with QAOA
This paper compares different QAOA variants for solving portfolio optimization problems. Using real financial data and simulation benchmarks, the authors evaluate how each approach performs. And by weighing both successes and limitations, the paper offers a realistic view of QAOA’s capabilities in finance and emphasizes the importance of doing more experimentation.

**Tools**
*Mathematics*: 
Linear algebra which can be used to represent quantum states (as vectors) and quantum operations (as matrices). 
Probability which represents  wach possible portfolio configuration as a certain probability of being the "optimal" result.
*Quantum Concepts*: 
Qubits, which represent each asset in the portfolio. For example, a qubit might be in state 1 if an asset is included, or 0 if it’s not.
Superposition, which allows to represent many possible portfolio combinations at once, making it faster and more efficient.
QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) which  applies alternating layers of quantum operations (based on the cost function and a mixer) to “steer” the quantum system toward better solutions.

**Goals**
Interested in studying finance / investments
Interested in taking quantum computing classes alongside finance classes
Interested in working at the intersection of finance and QIS/AI
